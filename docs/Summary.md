## Summary

Dynamograph is project created under Google Summer of Code program - but will not die with the end of it. It will be further developed to support more datasets.
 
### Conclusions 

Created prototype of graph database is really great entry point for creating more complex solution that will handle all types of datasets important from bio4j perspective.
Whole experience taken from building this solution will be extremely useful in creating production code and what is more important ensure that such project could be realized with given set of languages and tools.
